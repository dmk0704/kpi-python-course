Python course: Lab2 
=====================

*A module was created during the laboratory.*
==============================================
* **Created five classes: Transport (main class), Automotive (descendant of Transport), Aircraft (descendant of Transport), Boat (descendants of Transport), Train (descendants of Transport).**
* **In class Transport created a constructor (__init__). Also created a method for overriding the output of an object as a string (method __str__).**
* **All child classes use additional attributes (such a wheel, group, propelles, engine).**
* **Transport can change speed (method move), this method control speed and compare speed with MaxSpeed characteristic.**
* **Use __doc__ for output description of module if module use as a script.**
* **To demonstrated the logic of the created classes, a function main() was created that is called by if __name__ == '__main__':.**
* **Another file was created to demonstrate the operation of the module as a library module. The module was connected using the import command..**
